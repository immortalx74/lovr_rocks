[![Img alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lvI_ScWK0-U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvI_ScWK0-U)<br />
NOTE: This is currently WIP<br />
Experimental Rhythm VR game modelled after the excellent Ragnarock game.<br />
Made with [LÖVR](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr)<br />
It reads and plays Ragnarock maps in multiple difficulties.<br />

Uses rxi's JSON library for loading maps: https://github.com/rxi/json.lua<br />

HOW TO RUN:<br />
Create a folder inside "res" named "songs" and put your downloaded Ragnarock maps in there.<br />
Drag the repository folder over lovr.exe and the game should start.<br />
NOTE: The game was only tested on Windows 11/Oculus Rift S.<br />
